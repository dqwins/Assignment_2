                <p>Outside can act as an escape from the mundane, repetitive, and stressful everyday life. Nature is a
                    place to release. You are forced to just breath, and
                    take one step at a time. </p>

                <p class="p5">This past summer was full of adventures there. I hiked a popular, short hike called Bears
                    Hump. Not only was I able to get in some exercise, but I saw an incredible view up at the top with
                    fresh, crip mountain air filling my lungs. I would also suggest taking a polar plunge afterwards
                    into Waterton Lake! The water is crystal clear and will give you an adrenaline rush with how cold
                    the water is. </p>
                <p class="p5">Red Rock Canyon is another place that I visited this summer. You walk up into the canyon,
                    going in and out of the water stream. It's a great hike for beginners! </p>
